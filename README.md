MultiTargetDeeplearningSoundClassification-MohammadJavadian&amp;Ali Abedi.    
The main goal of this project is to classify sounds using sound's MFCC processed by CNN model.  
Cat,dog and traffic sounds such as fire trucks and ambulances are used as a dataset.  
Our idea was gotten from Mike Smales's article https://medium.com/@mikesmales/sound-classification-using-deep-learning-8bc2aa1990b7 .
