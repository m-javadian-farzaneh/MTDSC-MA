MultiTargetDeeplearningSoundClassification-MohammadJavadian&amp;Ali Abedi
The main goal of this project is to classify sounds with deeplearning(CNN structure)
you have two cases to train your model,simple or cnn.we train our model on cat and dog sounds and also on traffic sounds such as
fire truck and cars at the trafic as well as ambulance
our idea was from Mike Smales's article https://medium.com/@mikesmales/sound-classification-using-deep-learning-8bc2aa1990b7
